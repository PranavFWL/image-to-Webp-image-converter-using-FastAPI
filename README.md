There are sample images given in the repository (img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg).
The rest of the images (img1.webp, img2.webp, img3.webp) are the converted images.
The Python program is in the webp.py file.
To run the program on your system:

Copy the name of your repository where the images are stored and pass it to the variable "repo_name".
Generate a token for your GitHub account and pass it to the variable "token".
Execute the program in the terminal. You should see the message "Stage 1 complete" on the page.
Go to the docs site (http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) and execute "fetch_img". Wait for a while, and you should see the names of the images with the .webp extension.
Go to your GitHub repository where the images were initially stored, refresh the page, and you should see the WebP format images.
